        "API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a set of protocols, tools, and standards that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In simple terms, an API specifies how two software components should interact with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is an example of how APIs are used in real life: Suppose you are using a mobile app to book a ride, like Uber or Lyft. These apps use APIs to communicate with mapping software to show you the location of available drivers and estimate the time it will take for your ride to arrive. When you enter your pickup and destination locations, the app uses APIs to send that information to the mapping software and receive data on the nearest available drivers and the fastest route to your destination. Once a driver is assigned, the app uses APIs to send notifications to the driver and the passenger, update the ride status, and process payments.\n",

        "Another example of an API in real life is when you use a weather app or website. These apps use APIs to communicate with weather data providers and retrieve current weather conditions, forecasts, and other weather-related data.\n",

In the REST architecture, data is represented as resources, which can be accessed and manipulated using a set of standardized HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

        "Limited Support: Some programming languages and platforms may not support SOAP, making it difficult to integrate with certain systems and applications.\n",
        "Slow Performance: SOAP can be slower than REST due to the additional overhead required to build and process SOAP messages.\n",
        "Limited Caching: SOAP messages are typically not cacheable, which can impact performance and scalability.\n",
